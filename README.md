# api-certificate-authority
.NET Core project as a collection of samples I developed for managing PKI using C# - this idea was scrapped for an openssl based implementation (which was a way better idea). I'm keeping it here in case I need to reference any of this in the future. This project is incomplete and messy.

Some of the samples demonstrate how to 

-Generate ROOT CA Certificates

-Generate Intermediate CA Certificates

-Certificate Signing

-Generate client authentication certificates (the main purpose of this project)

-Define certificate signature algorithms 

-Manage Certificate Revocation Lists

-Decode ASN Data

-Build ASN Encoded data (for certificate extensions)

-Parse existing certificates and extract specific fields
